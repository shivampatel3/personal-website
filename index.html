    <div class="lead__sub">
      I'm a fourth year computer science student at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I'm deeply curious and enjoy learning and applying machine learning, full-stack web development, and quantitative modeling wherever I can provide value. In my free time I enjoy watching soccer, playing basketball, and playing card and board games.
